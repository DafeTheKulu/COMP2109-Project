COMP2109: Final Project

This is my final project for COMP2109 in the Winter 2023 semester at Georgian.
I attempted to make a simple store using WordPress.

The intention of the project was to show off my abilities with WordPress and its WooCommerce plugin.
Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances and a loss in my family limiting my time the past month, the project is in an unfinished state.

The project consists of a homepage with a featured product inserted with a shortcode, 3 categories of posts with a sample post in each,
and a shop with 6 placeholder items sorted into 3 categories. I attempted to make custom templates for the homepage,
posts, and shop items using field groups in Advanced Custom Fields, but issues eventually wore me down and I scrapped the code
in order to restore the pages to a basic degree of functionality. Currently, all pages are simply using WordPress and 
WooCommerce's default templates and styles. The Contact form was made with the WPForms plugin.

The checkout is currently non-functional due to issues setting up the test payment gateway and connecting the localhost site to WordPress.com.

The custom header and footer are functional with minimal custom styling.

In the future I hope to attempt a personal project in WordPress to redeem myself.
